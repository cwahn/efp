# Eager Functional Programming

This library is for eager functional programming with C++.  

## Examples
WIP

## Features
### Zero-Copy Iterable Types
WIP

### StaticVector
WIP

## Requirements

Since this library relies on C++ 11 STL, the machine should support it as well. This is because, the library uses `std::array` (or C-style array sometimes) for statically sized iterable, and `std::vector` for dynamically sized iteable.

## License

This library is open-source under The MIT Liscence.
